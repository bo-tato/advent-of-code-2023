# Advent of Code

Solutions in Common Lisp to Advent of Code 2023. I don't just stick to the
standard library but use several modern libraries like
[serapeum](https://github.com/ruricolist/serapeum) and
[str](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str) that make solving AoC type problems in
Common Lisp more convenient even than in python imo.

For some days you also need `(cl-interpol:enable-interpol-syntax)`
